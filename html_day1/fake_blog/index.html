		<h1>The Art of Channeling Our Natural Innevitability of Sublimation</h1>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Sublimation is when a repressed human emotion, thought, idea, feeling, etc. sits bubbling, locked away for so long in a person's subconscious that it has to come out and does so in some physcially recognizable way; whether that way be the form of art (poetry, painting, etc.), a major achievement (such as winning an olympic medal), wars... Literally anything from the earth shattering to the most minor occurrence happens, Freud concluded credit should be given to the fact that, in one way or another, that individual human and/or societal mental repression manifested itself into something physical, undeniable, and universally tangible.</h3>
